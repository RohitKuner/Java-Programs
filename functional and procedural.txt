    syntax : () -> {}

    usage --> lambda is mainly used to implement the Functional interface(SAM)
        EX for SAM --> Runnable() , and Comparable()

    Functional interface which has exactly has only one Abstract methods

    @FunctionalInterface ---> Annotation 

            New Features Introduces in Java 8 are :

        1.Predicate    2.Consumer    3.Function       4.Supplier


    1.Predicate ---> Bipredicate
    2.Consumer ---> BiConsumer
    3.Function ---> BiFunction, UnaryOperator, BinaryOperator
